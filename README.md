## Features — Planned

- **Solo skill scenarios** — planned module; not implemented.
- **Equipment test records** — planned module; not implemented.
- **Profile isolation checklist** — planned module; not implemented.

The proposed workflow separates solo skill scenarios from equipment test records, with profile isolation checklist retained for reproducibility. These are design goals, not claims about existing functionality.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A Markdown viewer or text editor.
- Your own test data and a separate copy if experiments are planned.
- Reading this specification does not require Node.js, Python, package installation, or account credentials.

### Review the documentation

1. Record the exact product version and input provenance.
2. Prepare a separate test copy, not your only original.
3. Describe one baseline scenario for **Solo skill scenarios**.
4. Review the acceptance criteria in [VERIFICATION.md](./VERIFICATION.md).
5. Do not treat this specification as proof of a working tool.

There are no application startup commands: an executable implementation has not been created.

## Security & Tools Configuration

Only user-owned local scenarios and manual notes. Offline availability and parameter editing for a particular build are NOT verified. No online-match features, ranking changes, or online currency operations. No process modification is implemented. Any future testing needs a separate save copy and a review of game rules.

Proposed design requirements: local processing, explicit file selection, separate outputs, and no default telemetry. These are requirements for a future implementation, not tested properties. Verify restoration on a copy before any state-changing operation.

## Usage Guide

### Solo skill scenarios

Define the input and expected outcome for module 1. Record the Borderlands 4 version, scenario conditions, and known limitations. Completing these notes manually does not establish that an automated tool exists.

### Equipment test records

Define the input and expected outcome for module 2. Record the Borderlands 4 version, scenario conditions, and known limitations. Completing these notes manually does not establish that an automated tool exists.

### Profile isolation checklist

Define the input and expected outcome for module 3. Record the Borderlands 4 version, scenario conditions, and known limitations. Completing these notes manually does not establish that an automated tool exists.

### At a glance

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Target | Borderlands 4 |
| Category | Offline game project |
| Input | Manual notes or user-authorized local exports |
| Planned output | Solo skill scenarios |
| Compatibility | Unverified; no supported version claimed |
| Current release | None |

### After an update

- [ ] Record the new version and input format changes.
- [ ] Repeat the baseline scenario on a copy.
- [ ] Mark old compatibility assumptions as unverified.
- [ ] Retain the previous report separately.
